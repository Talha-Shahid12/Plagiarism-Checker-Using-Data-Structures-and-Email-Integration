## Introduction

The Plagiarism Checker with Email Integration project is designed to assist users in detecting plagiarism in textual content. It processes input documents and checks for similarities across them. In addition, the project incorporates email integration to send notifications to users with the results of the plagiarism analysis.

## Features

- **Plagiarism Detection**: Users can submit two or more text documents for plagiarism analysis. The project will identify similarities between these documents and indicate potential plagiarism.

- **Percentage Calculation**: The project calculates the percentage of similarity between the submitted documents, providing an idea of the level of plagiarism.

- **Email Notifications**: The system sends email notifications to users with the plagiarism analysis results. This feature ensures that users are promptly informed about the outcome.

## Data Structures

The Plagiarism Checker project leverages various data structures to perform efficient plagiarism analysis:

- **Stack And Queues**: Stack and queue is used to store those words which are similar in assignment of students.

- **Arrays**: Arrays store metadata about words and their frequency in documents, enabling efficient similarity calculations.

- **Linked Lists**: Linked lists help manage words within documents and maintain their order.
  
- **Sorting**: Sorting Techniques are applied for calculating percentages of plagiarism of previous and current student.

- **Trees**: Trees are also used in this project to integrate the words of assignments of both students.

- **Searching**: Searching is base concept of this project to compare and contrast the assignments.

## Email Integration

Email notifications are integrated into the project to provide timely updates to users:

- The project utilizes SMTP libraries to send well-formatted email notifications to users.

- Once the plagiarism analysis is complete, an email is sent to users containing the results of the analysis, including the percentage of similarity between documents.
